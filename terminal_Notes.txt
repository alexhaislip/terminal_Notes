Ditto
A hidden gem in OS X is Apple’s ditto command. I’ve found this incredibly useful in copying large amounts of data as it can run within a Terminal window that contains more useful information about its progress than the more traditional Finder copy window.

1
$ ditto -V /old/work/ /new/work/
The above command will copy our “work” folder to a new location. Actually, what happens is the command copies the contents of our “work” folder to a new “work” folder.

Adding -V, meaning verbose prints a line to the Terminal window for every file that’s being copied. It’s extremely useful as you can see exactly what file is being copied at any time.

Ditto is a command I use frequently and have often copied many gigabytes of data between hard drives using it because it seems to be so reliable.

Stress Test Your Mac
If you’re wanting to run some stress tests on your Mac, there’s a simple command we can enter that will instantly utilise 100% of your CPU:

1
$ yes
Apple technicians use this frequently when dealing with troublesome Macs that might be crashing under load and it’s a very quick way of stressing a Mac. To cancel the command, press Ctrl-C.



Display A Custom Message At The Login Window
When using a multi-user Mac, it’s often good to have a message display to provide some useful information, such as “Hey, sticky hands! Others have to use this keyboard, y’know.”

1
$ sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow LoginwindowText "Hey, Sticky Hands!"
Next time you log out or restart your Mac, your message will appear. To remove the message entirely:

1
$ sudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow LoginwindowText


View File System Usage
Sometimes we want to see what our Mac is doing when it comes to reading and writing to disk, especially if we’re trying to identify something that’s preventing us from ejecting a drive. To do this, we use:

1
$ sudo fs_usage
By entering sudo, we are requesting to run this as a super user, which requires entering our Mac’s login password. Once done, you’re presented with a constant stream of information as processes are accessing your disk.

Some processes you are likely to see are Time Machine (backupd) and Spotlight (mds).

To cancel, you can press Ctrl-C.






Working with Directories:
ls - list / list the contents on your current directory
la -la - Give more informations about list 
pwd - Print Working directory / Print the path to the working directory
cd directory - Change directory / Move between folders - Relative Path (just folters directly contained in the one you are currently)
cd /firstDirectory/secondDirectory/FinalDirectory - Absolute Path (search a directory anywhere in pc)
cd .. - Go back a directory
cd ~ - return to home directory
mkdir - make directory / create a new directory+
mkdir -v - Make directory + add lines that say you created a directory
touch - Create a file (or multiple) or "touch", change a file (update when it was last modified)
rm - Remove / Delete a File (forever)
rm -rf - Remove recursive force / Delete a directory add all file nested in the directory (also other directories)
rmdir - remove a directory (only work on empty folders)



Change Directory

	cd <dir> - change directory
	cd .. - go to parent directory

File And Directory Management:

	mkdir <dir name> - make new directory
	touch <filename> - make new file

	mv <filename> <filename> - rename file in current directory
	mv <filename> <dir> - move file into directory
	rm <filename> - delete file
	rm -rf <dir> - delete directory - Careful with this
